# Element Database Backend
This is a go package which may end up being the driving force behind Element's media query system.  It will manage all user searchable such as scanned plugins, presets, and more! Go is an interesting solution because it can be compiled with the app as a C-library, but can also very easily serve itself with a REST api for other apps and services to utilize.
