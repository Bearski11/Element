# Element Projucer Projects
These projects are provided as a convenience to Mac/PC __developers__ who aren't comfortable with `waf` and want to __contribute__ to the project. They are not actually used to produce code signed binaries by Kushview.

Linux exporters don't exists in these projects.  If you're on Linux, please use waf. _See [building.md](../../docs/building.md)_

If you're compiling for just __personal__ use of the software... advice from developers is bare minimum.

__Directories__
* `Element` - Element plugin (instrument variety)
* `ElementFX` - Element plugin (effect variety)
* `Standalone` - Element standalone
